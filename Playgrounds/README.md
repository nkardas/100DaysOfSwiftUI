# Playgrounds Folder

This folder contains Swift Playground files that I’ve created as part of the **100 Days of SwiftUI** course. These interactive coding environments are designed to help me practice and reinforce the concepts learned throughout the course.

## Purpose of the Playgrounds

- **Hands-On Practice**: Each playground focuses on specific Swift concepts, allowing me to experiment with code in a controlled environment.
- **Immediate Feedback**: I can see the results of my code changes in real-time, which helps in understanding how different elements work together.
- **Exploration**: The playgrounds encourage me to explore new ideas and functionalities without the overhead of creating a full app.

## How to Use This Folder

1. Open any `.playground` file in Xcode.
2. Read through the comments and instructions provided within each playground.
3. Modify the code to see how changes affect the output.
