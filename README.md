# 100 Days Of SwiftUI

The **100 Days of SwiftUI** is designed for beginners who want to learn iOS app development effectively. The course includes a mix of videos, tutorials, and hands-on coding exercises.

## Repository Structure

- **/Playgrounds**: Swift Playground files for interactive coding.
- **/Projects**: Complete Xcode projects developed throughout the course.
- **/Resources**: Additional materials and references to aid learning.

## Course Breakdown

## Preparation

- **Day 0**: Tips and advice before starting the course.

## Days 1-14: Introduction to Swift

In the first 14 days, I will cover the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. Key topics include:

- Variables, constants, strings, and numbers
- Booleans and string interpolation
- Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
- Control flow (if statements, switch cases)
- Functions and parameters
- Closures and structs
- Classes and inheritance
- Protocols and optionals

## Consolidation Days

These days are essential for reflection and reinforcement. They allow me to review what I've learned and to catch up on any missed topics.

## Days 16-100: Building Apps

During this phase, I will progressively build real SwiftUI apps:

- **Days 16-24**: Start building real applications using foundational knowledge.
- **Days 26-34**: Expand skills with new projects while practicing fundamentals.
- **Days 36-46**: Scale up to larger applications incorporating advanced features.
- **Days 49-59**: Focus on data management within apps.
- **Days 62-76**: Integrate external frameworks like Core Image and MapKit.
- **Days 79-94**: Build larger apps with enhanced user interaction elements.
- **Days 96-99**: Complete a final project that covers optimization techniques for iPad apps.

## Tools Used

- **Xcode**: Integrated development environment for macOS.
- **Swift Playgrounds**: Interactive learning environment for coding in Swift.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools.

## Progress Tracking

I will update this repository with new projects and playgrounds as I complete each day of the course.
